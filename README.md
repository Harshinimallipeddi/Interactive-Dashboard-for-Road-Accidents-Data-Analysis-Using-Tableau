# Road-Accidents-Data-Analysis-Using-Tableau

### Description:
This repository showcases an interactive dashboard created using Tableau for analyzing road accidents data. Leveraging data, the dashboard provides insightful visualizations and interactive elements to explore and understand patterns and trends in road accidents.

### Key Features:
Comprehensive Visualization: Displays various metrics related to road accidents, such as accident frequency, severity, locations, and contributing factors.
Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data by year and severity to gain a detailed understanding of specific aspects of the data.
Trend Analysis: Provides insights into trends over time, identifying periods with increased accident rates and potential causes.
Geospatial Analysis: Includes maps that visualize accident hotspots and geographic patterns, helping to identify high-risk areas.
Customizable Dashboards: Users can interact with the dashboard to explore different scenarios and make data-driven decisions.
### Objective:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to develop interactive dashboards that can effectively present complex datasets and facilitate data-driven insights. This project is inspired by various tutorials and resources on YouTube, showcasing how similar techniques can be applied to create meaningful and actionable visualizations on cleaned dataset which we can obtain by using Data Interpreter.

### Technologies Used:
Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation.
